# Educare — College Website (Vite + React)

A responsive single-page college website template built with Vite and React. It provides common sections for an educational site (hero, programs, campus, testimonials, contact, video player, and more) so you can jumpstart front-end work for college or school projects.

**Key features:**
- Clean, componentized React layout using Vite for fast dev server and build.
- Sections included: Hero, Navbar, Programs, Campus, Testimonials, About, Contact, VideoPlayer, Footer.
- Lightweight dependency set and simple build scripts.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites: Node.js (16+) and npm/yarn installed.

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Preview the production build locally

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Project structure (high level)

- `src/` — application source
  - `App.jsx` — root app component

  - `Components/` — reusable UI sections
    - `Hero/`, `Navbar/`, `Programs/`, `Campus/`, `Testimonials/`, `About/`, `Contact/`, `Footer/`, `VideoPlayer/`, `Title/`

See the source to customize sections and styles.
